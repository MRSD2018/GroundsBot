# GroundsBot  
An Outdoor Grounds Care and Maintenance System  
  
# Project Description
A flexible system that can perform regular outdoor grounds maintenance tasks such a sidewalk sweeping, snow clearing or grass cutting on extreme terrain for use by grounds care and snow removal companies. GroundsBot would be a versatile multi-season autonomous appliance that can perform grounds maintenance action in a wide range of situations. Typical existing robot grounds care systems are limited to cutting grass in a well-defined, restricted area. GroundsBot is able to perform useful activity year-round through a flexible design approach. This flexibility extends to operation in rough or hilly terrain, snow conditions or night operation. Existing sensor systems are frequently restricted in their environment of application. GroundsBot would use a highly flexible, integrated sensor suite that is able to adapt to changing environmental and topological conditions associated with various outdoor grounds tasks.  Critical algorithms include unique path planning with a specific purpose and adaptive control algorithms that respond to different situations such as spinning wheels or changes to center of gravity.  A demonstration of interest would be for GroundsBot to perform three tasks with only 15 minutes of equipment configuration change between the conduct of each task. The outdoor grounds care market could be huge with the right capabilities and price points. Lawn care companies and even some individuals would find such an all- season system highly desirable.

# Project Goals  
A series of demonstrations that illustrate basic design concepts and effectiveness and the ability to mature concepts into marketable products.
