\section{Project Description}

\begin{center}
GroundsBot \\
\end{center}

Humans spend a lot of time mowing grass. This is particularly true for golf courses. Golf courses have hundreds of acres of land requiring careful maintenance.  The median club in the United States spends \$1.2 million per year on maintenance [reference]. A Pittsburgh area golf course manager revealed that his staff spends 65\% of their time mowing, and 60\% of that time is spent just on the rough. This is an industry ripe for automation.
\\
\\
Autonomous mowers are commercially available today, however most of these units require buried wires, beacons, or extensive mapping to provide boundaries. For a golf course, the mowing area is so large that those setup methods are a barrier to deployment. The GroundsBot team aims to deliver a prototype autonomous mower that can be deployed with a simple rough user sketch on a map.


\subsection{Functional Requirements}
Groundsbot shall:
  Receive mowing regions \\
  Cut grass at the correct height \\
  Create a mowing plan \\
  Cut the rough  \\
  Avoid obstacles \\
  Provide feedback to the groundskeeper \\

\section{Functional Architecture}
  There are three sub-systems that combine to accomplish the functionality needed for GroundsBot (Figure~\ref{fig:functional}). The User Interface accepts inputs from the groundskeeper, generating detailed mowing regions. The Charging Dock acts as a home point for charging the robot, while also providing a reference signal for correcting localization issues. The Mowing Robot includes internal sub-systems which enable the robot to navigate the golf course, cut the rough, and return to the charging dock when needed.\\

  The Mowing Robot sub-system is responsible for many critical tasks in the overall mowing system. The Mowing Platform is one internal sub-system that ensures effective mowing operations by storing energy, providing mobility, and docking when charging is needed. The Platform Electronics sub-system provides electrical controls for the motors and hosts the computing resources needed to run the algorithms for mowing. The sensor data provided by this sub-system is crucial for the remaining systems, enabling full mowing autonomy.\\
  
  The remaining sub-systems within the Mowing Robot include Online Perception, Robot Localization, Navigation Planning, and Control. These software systems provide Groundsbot with awareness of surroundings, knowledge of position, and in-depth details about the grass. This enables successful navigation through complicated environments, and provides the information necessary to control GroundsBot effectively.\\

\end{figure}

  The user interface and IO subsystems are the contact points for the operator.  The wifi access point allows the user to load mowing boundaries from their laptop or mobile device.  This also enables the user to download coverage reports and diagnostics.  Status LEDs allow the operator to understand the system status at a glance, while safety beacons alert humans to GroundsBot's presence at a distance.\\

  GroundsBot uses its sensor suite to ensure a clean cut. GPS, IMU, and Motor Encoders are used for coarse localization while the cameras are used to ensure optimal grass overlap while cutting.  Cameras and lidar also enable GroundsBot to detect static and dynamic obstacles.\\

  GroundsBot's battery subsystem reports charge status to the CPU to prevent GroundsBot from becoming stranded. The battery subsystem also contains standard protection protocols including charge control, under-voltage lockout, and over-current protection. \\

  The CPU utilizes sensor information for localization, obstacle detection, and planning.  After a local path is devised drive signals are sent to the motors. The CPU also logs coverage data and generates reports.\\

  The Drive Train contains motors and motor drivers to propel GroundsBot across a golf course.  This also encompasses the mowing apparatus and mowing deck height control. \\



\section{Subsystem Descriptions}
	\subsection{UI}
	An important aspect of the project is a way for the user to communicate his desired mowing path to the robot. This input method must be separate from the robot itself, allowing the user to be somewhere else as the robot mows autonomously. 
	
	This will be achieved through a mobile device, either a dedicated tablet or the user's own smartphone. An app or website will be loaded onto this device, and allow for the user to input a map outline that will be communicated to the robot. 
	
	\subsection{Hardware}
		\subsubsection{Platform}
			Based on the trade study, a differential drive system with two drive wheels and one or more caster wheels will be used. Another trade study was used to narrow down the platform to DIY platform instead of a preexisting platform. This custom platform will utilize aluminum extrusions, allowing for easy resizing of the platform as well as easy adjustment of the sensor mounts. Currently, motors and batteries from Discovery Robotics will be integrated, but alternate products may be also be considered. 
			
		\subsubsection{Mower}
			In addition to navigating a plot of grass, the system also needs to mow it. Given that a custom platform will be made, this will be done by attaching an existing electric push mower to the robot platform. Alternatively, it is also possible to attach the blades from a manual reel mower to the platform. 
	
	\subsection{Software}
		\subsubsection{Planner}
			The planner subsystem consists of two parts, a global planner, and  a local planner. The global planner will take the user input from the UI, and translate that into a path that the robot will follow. This involves refining the outline that was provided by the user, and then finding a path that will allow for maximal coverage of the selected area. 
			
			The local planner will be responsible for adapting the route on-the-fly to avoid any obstacles that the robot may encounter. This system will also take care of the driving to and from the dock to the actual cutting area. 
			
		\subsubsection{Localization and Perception}
			An accurate description of the robot's global position and orientation will be obtained from this subsystem. This information may be obtained from a high-accuracy GPS system, such as RTK-GPS, but visual SLAM based methods will also be investigated. 
			
			The vision system will also be used to detect boundaries of the grass as the robot gets closer to the boundary. For obstacle detection, a trade study determined that a stereo camera system would best fit the detection requirements. However, if needed, a LIDAR may be added to improve the detection accuracy. 
		
		\subsubsection{Mobility}
			The mobility subsystem will be responsible for the control of the robot's motors. Part of this involves the robot going from point A to point B at any given time. Using current position information from localization subsystem, this subsystem will find the next waypoint that will allow for the robot to follow the predetermined plan and then emit the necessary motor control signals to move towards this waypoint. 
			
			The cutter motor speeds will also be controlled by this subsystem. This subsystem must both detect the speed of the motor, as well as apply the correct motor signals to maintain a constant speed when the cutter encounters an obstacle.

\subsubsection{Progress Reviews}

\subsection{System Validation Experiments}
\subsubsection{Fall Validation Experiment}

	The aim of the fall validation experiment is to test individual subsystems. As such many of the systems requirements set for GroundsBot will not be fully met. All tests to be performed have been designed to indicate significant progress towards reaching the system requirements. More specifically the team plans to test the base functionality of the mobility, localization, planning, and perception subsystems of GroundsBot. The details of the test are laid out below.
		
Location: Field by Doherty Apartments

Equipment: GroundsBot, GroundsBot dock/RTK base station, laptop

Test 1 Procedure:

1. Power on GroundsBot next to its docking station

2. Establish connection between GroundsBot and mobile device

3. Input GPS waypoints following a typical zigzag pattern a groundskeeper might make when mowing a lawn

4. Send waypoints to GroundsBot

5. GroundsBot will navigate to each waypoint entered, in the order they were entered

6. Once the last waypoint is reached, GroundsBot will navigate back to the docking station (Note: the docking station will not be one of the entered waypoints)

Test 2 has been designed to demonstrate base functionality of the perception subsystem. The team will present perception algorithm capable of differentiating between grass(i.e. a mowable surface) and non-grass (i.e. a non-mowable surface.) This test will be performed outside of the fall validation experiment and a replay of the test will be displayed during the fall validation experiment.

\subsubsection{Spring Validation Experiment}

	The spring validation experiment will be when the team will test the full GroundsBot system to demonstrate that all system requirements have been met. The details of the test are laid out below.
	
Location: Field by Doherty Apartments

Equipment: GroundsBot, GroundsBot dock/RTK base station, mobile device

Test Procedure:

1. Power on GroundsBot next to its docking station

2. Open UI on mobile interface and establish a connection with GroundsBot

3. Have a new user (someone not on Team A) use the UI to draw an outline of the area to be mowed on a map

	Area should include both static obstacles and a non-mowable surface (i.e. concrete)
	
4. Use the UI to submit the mowing area to GroundsBot

5. Groundsbot will develop a coverage plan of the area input by the user


6. Groundsbot will navigate to the area to be mowed
7. Once it has reached the edge of the mowing area it will begin mowing

8. GroundsBot will detect and avoid any obstacles it comes across while mowing and will also only mow where there is grass

9. Once GroundsBot has mowed the whole area it will return to the docking station

10. GroundsBot will generate and transmit a coverage report to the UI indicating areas it could not mow
